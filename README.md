# depth-of-parentheses

## 1st Objective
Solve the problem of determining the deepest depth of a string of parentheses.

i.e. `"(()((())))()"`

Wait... What if the string is not symmetrical?

## 2nd Objective
Add some logic to determine if the string of parentheses is not symmetrical. Maybe indicate which parenthesis type there are more of?

i.e. `"(())())))"`

## 3rd Objective
Track the number of opening and closing parentheses, even if the string of parentheses is not symmetrical.

## 4th Objective
Write a GUI/Interface that allows a user to specify the string and document in real-time the depth of the array. Use a framework/library like `Angular`, `Vue`, or `React`?

## 5th Objective
Color-code matching oppening and closing parentheses like the `vsCode` [Rainbow Brackets](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31778413/run-javascript-in-visual-studio-code) extension.
