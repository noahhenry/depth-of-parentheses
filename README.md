# depth-of-parentheses

## 1st Objective
Solve the problem of determining the deepest depth of a string of parentheses.

i.e. `"(()((())))()"`

Wait... What if the string is not symmetrical?

## 2nd Objective
Add some logic to determine if the string of parentheses is not symmetrical. Maybe indicate which parenthesis type there are more of?

i.e. `"(())())))"`
